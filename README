This extension displays the number of active Pidgin conversations on a
small icon in the panel status area. Clicking the icon presents a menu
which lists the conversations. When a conversation receives a new
message, the icon will change to a shade of red until you interact with
the conversation.

For best results, change your Pidgin preferences so "Hide new
conversation windows" is set to "Always".

The extension may be buggy due to the unpredictablility of some of
Pidgin's DBus signals.
